print("## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe have an undirected dynamic graph where each edge is represented by three values: the nodes it connects and the time at which they become connected.\n\n## Step 2: Verify the existence of nodes, time, and edges\nThe problem statement provides us with the edges:\n- (0, 1, 9)\n- (0, 3, 8)\n- (1, 3, 6)\n- (1, 4, 5)\n\nThis implies the existence of nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 since these are the nodes mentioned in the edges. However, we also need to consider the possibility of other nodes existing that are not explicitly listed but could be implied through connections. For instance, node 2's connection status isn't directly stated, so we must verify its existence based on the information provided.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the initial state of the graph\nAt time 0, only the edge (0, 1, 9) exists because it has the earliest time stamp among all the given edges.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the connectivity over time\nTo find out when node 0 and node 2 are first connected, we need to analyze how the graph changes over time due to the addition of new edges.\n\n## Step 5: Check for direct connections from node 0 to node 2\nThere is no edge directly connecting node 0 to node 2 in the given list of edges.\n\n## Step 6: Explore indirect connections through intermediate nodes\nSince there's no direct edge between 0 and 2, we look for paths through other nodes. The given edges suggest potential paths through nodes 1 and 3.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the path through node 1\nFrom step 3, we know (0, 1, 9) exists initially. Then, (1, 3, 6) appears later, creating a path from 0 to 3 via 1. However, this doesn't help connect 0 to 2 directly or indirectly without considering further connections.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the role of node 3 in connecting other nodes\nNode 3 becomes connected to both 0 and 1 before any mention of a connection to 2. Since there's no direct or indirect path from 0 to 2 through the given edges, especially considering the absence of any edge involving node 2 until we've exhausted all possibilities, we conclude that the question might imply a misunderstanding or missing information about node 2's connections.\n\n## Step 9: Conclusion based on given data\nGiven the lack of any edge involving node 2 and the inability to form a path from node 0 to node 2 using the provided edges, we cannot determine a specific time when node 0 and node 2 are first connected based solely on the information given.\n\n## Step 10: Final determination\nSince we cannot establish a connection between node 0 and node 2 based on the provided edges, and assuming the problem intends to ask for a definitive answer based on the given data, we must conclude that the answer cannot be determined with the information provided.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$"
