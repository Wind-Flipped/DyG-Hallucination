Example:
Suppose you are solving a problem where you need to determine the earliest timestamp when node A and B become connected in a dynamic graph.
##STEP_1: Consider the edge between node A and node C at time t_1.
At time t_1, an edge links node A to node C. This means nodes A and C are directly linked. However, since the target nodes A and B are not yet connected, we will proceed to consider additional edges.
##STEP_2: Consider the edge between node B and node C at time t_2.
At time t_2, an edge links node B to node C. This creates an indirect connection between node A and node B through node C. Now, nodes A and B are connected for the first time at timestamp t_2.
##Conclusion:
By evaluating edges in the dynamic graph sequentially, we determine that the earliest timestamp when nodes A and B become connected is t_2.'''

Example:
Suppose you are solving a problem where you need to determine the earliest timestamp when node A and node B become connected in a dynamic graph.
##STEP_1: Consider node A.
At the first step, we examine the edges linked to node A. Node A is connected to node C,D at time t_1. This means node A has a direct connection to node C,D at t_1, but it is not yet connected to node B. The next step will involve examining the edges linked to node B to determine if a connection to node A exists.
##STEP_2: Consider node B.
At the next step, we examine the edges linked to node B. Node B is connected to node C,E at time t_2. Since node C is already connected to node A from step 1, this creates an indirect connection between node A and node B through node C. Thus, nodes A and B become connected for the first time at t_2.
